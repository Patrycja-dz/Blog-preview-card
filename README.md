## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of HTML and CSS, particularly in using custom properties and managing hover states effectively. Below are some examples of code that I am proud of:

```html
<h2 class="title">HTML & CSS foundations</h2>
```

```css
.title:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
  color: var(--primary-yellow);
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    to right,
    #23abd4,
    var(--neutral-grey) 50%,
    var(--neutral-white) 50%
  );
  background-size: 200% 100%;
  background-position: -100%;
  transition: all 0.8s ease-in-out;
  text-shadow: 0 0 0 var(--primary-yellow);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to focus more on:

- Enhancing responsive design techniques
- Implementing advanced CSS animations
- Improving accessibility features

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - A great resource for various CSS techniques and tips.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - Comprehensive documentation on web technologies including HTML and CSS.
